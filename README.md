# MyVimRc
Based on https://vim-bootstrap.com/

To install copy the .vimrc to your $HOME
# cp .vimrc ~/

The existence of the .vimrc should turn of compatibility mode. If it doesn't start vim with
# vim -N

The first time you start vim with this .vimrc you might see a bunch of erros. Mainly because there is configs for modules that are not there yet.
Don't worry exit out of vim after the initial install is done and then open it again.
